Thoughts on setting up db updating service:


1) need to start recording db version numbers.
2) I could either:  
------a) Create a universal upgrade tool which find the missing values and fills them in with defaults
------b) or Create a db migration tool which has specific methods for upgrade from each specific db version 
------- to the newest version (this would allow for more modification/deletion/etc but would be much more 
------- work)

tips for dev from Yasmin: 
Need more users in testing
get more users on
use figma walk through app with real user 
after you talk to 5 users you've found 80% of the corrections needed
get as many as possible to test on different os and devices 
something nice to have.... if they haven't upgraded show a popup... there's a new update














UI missing:

(X) realign bar chart labels
(X) switch all charts to new style
(X) update rest of track style
(X) update the rest of home style

Fix menu pages:

(X) Basic info
(X) health profile
--(X) finish vaginalRing / Patch / and Pill details pages (should be straightforward)
--(X) finish adding and modifying health conditions
(X) notification settings
(X) general settings
(X) unique colors for tab backgrounds

Funtionality missing:

(X) Onboarding, update/replace datepicker
(X) health profile screen doesn't sync with redux profile

before alpha 2.0 pre-release:

(X) update onboarding date
(X) 10 seeds per day max
(X) fix password vulnerability
(X) fix footer add symptom button bug
(X) fix dates and times displaying entire gmt date
--(/) they should display times and dates using the local time zone
(X) fix welcome message on home page so it's always clear, either moving it lower, to the white section, flipping the image, etc
(X) endo101 progress flower / indicator

Bugs left:

(X) only 1 seeds added per day only logged symptom
(X) reminderTime on Vaginal Ring (and probably other health profile pages) doesn't open to time select, stuck on date select
----ERROR Warning: Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component.
(/) need to strip away whitespace on strings/inputs generally (login especially)
(x) frozen loading ios loging page, doesn't not matter if rememberme is checked or not
(X) need to fix bottom margin in profile setup onboarding

New Bugs:

(X) how are you feeling today symptom entry date is wrong, stuck in 2020, or 2021
(/) need to fix timezones, I don't really awknowledge or use them right now, seems to be causing
bugs in symptom entry / display right now. If you click to edit a date on the calendar, for me
at least it always selects the day of the date before, though the calendar is returning the date
selected exactly, in epoch convertor it does the same conversion because it says it's switching
to the local timezone..... so seems like a good things to check out. I might need to adjust throughout
-I think the calendar might be in a different timezone by default

Tech Timeline:

(x)Android and IOS Beta 1.0 - July 20, 2022
(/)App course weeks 1-6 integrated August 1, 2022
()Pilot September 2022

-Clean up IOS UI / achieve RN parity
-Finish public profile implementation
-Finish calendar implementation
-Finish calculated stats implementation
-Finish displayed stats and graphs on Track and Home implementation
-Finish new settings UI

-Release full Android and IOS apps.
-Debug Android app
-Debug IOS app
-RN Jest full app testing suite
-RN Detox E2E full app testing with 100% coverage
-End user validation IOS
-End user validation Android

potential statistical libraries:

-stdlib looks pretty good for a large set of features
-simple-statistics looks great, seems to be exactly what it says

Endo101 Course TODO:
(x) week1 endo course prototype
(x) fix week1 page formatting done: [(DONE)module1, (DONE)module2, (DONE)module3, (DONE)module4, (DONE)module5, (DONE)module6]
(x) add in local page Logic for week1[(DONE)module1, (DONE)module2, (DONE)module3, (DONE)module4, (DONE)module5, (DONE)module6]
(x) add in learn reducer state management for week1
(x) blocking logic [(DONE)module1, (DONE)module2, (DONE)module3, (DONE)module4, (DONE)module5, (DONE)module6]

TODO July 2022:
(x) skip app intro if login data saved
(x) track and home stats / graphs should be live and accurate
(x) need to sync course state at least once a day (check in menu on update, keep timestamp of last sync)

Bugs July 2022:

(x) possible log in / log out savestate bug
(x) need to fix timezones when displayed and entered (i believe it's fixed, calendar is synced at least)
(x) crazy formatting bug my Mom found on IOS
(x) unordered objects on ios bug
(x) ios crash .set() on logout bug (fixed I think)
(x) fix all ios warnings / errors in terminal
(x) format wrong on chatbotintro, text overflowing need to add scrollview
(x) need to add scrollview to garden just in case, to accomodate very small phones
(x) crash at edit and home button on garden page on android

Maggie Notes Aug 2, 2022:

(x) (daily sync)need to save / sync the app state more often with the server. It seems to forget user details a lot
(x) (bug)if you log in and skip the intro again, it overwrites your previous progress (must not be
------grabbing redux data from last session and instead is just grabbing / setting with default)
(x) shorter todo list on home page (remove confirm address)
(x) add endo course (shortcut) to home page before menstrual stats
(x) remove what do you need today section completely
(x) (bug) learn course week1 progress not advancing after finishing module1... locked out of other modules
(x) change endo101 course, make boxes follow the path

To Finish before Alpha 3.1 release:

(x) logout sometimes doesn't log out if rememberme is selected, just loops back into app
(x) Learn course: (listen to formatting explanation on video)
---(x) bullet points indented
---(x) text broken up more (every 2-3 sentences, maybe bold some words)
(x) need to make all screens stretch to fill entire height, particularly short screens (see garden ex.)
(x) fix shadow gradient on top of each page, make it follow scroll window (there is a visual bug in IOS)
(x) need to figure out a way to migrate / update old redux db's when updates are pushed
-----maybe just keep it simple.... I know what has changed each time.....
-----I'll just write a series of transforms that each db needs to get current
-----then in the future if a db is several version back I'll just run several transforms in a row
-----sequentially until they reach the most recent version

Interview August 2022 changes TODO:

(x) onboarding, none option for school needed
(x) symptom tracking, added default stress and pain sliders to symptom tracking (add to top general cat)
(x) fix formatting with achievement stats on home page / font stacking consitency on track stats and home stats
(x) garden, change dig up feature so you need to click a dig up button to activate the mode, prevents accidents / lowers stress
(x) choose alternative for IOS font
(x) onboarding (wait for bot to ask question first before showing popup)


General TODO:

(x) create cloud function for getting public user profiles of everyone in your chat group 
------(x) call this on once on login, only updates on login which is enough 
------(x) amie profile screen doesn't reflect other user's redux profile
------(/) connect page: endo card should reflect number of members, and member images
------(x) Image icons should all reflect choices, including health coach / moderator
(x) endo101 week4 advanced logic needed

Possibly same bug #1:
() Badly formatted email using rememberme after successful login attemp
() possibly password bug.... where it doesn't aceept the correct password after possibly using rememberme




Possible same bug #2:
---- seems to be a logout sync to server corruption bug..... the state is fine....
----- but null values are introduced on logout and are saved in the server, corrupting the garden etc
----- I think 
(/) undefined bug on logout after buying and planting in the garden, undefined plot bug in 
savestate. Only seems to appear on first logout, garden plots do not seem to save, 
it remembers planting and removes them from the player inventory, but the plots do not save. 
This is also without finishing the profile, so maybe that's the problem? 
it wipes the garden data for some reason? undefined is not an item type bug now for itemtype 
in the playerinvetory.... hmm needs more research
ERROR TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'newChartStats
["chart5SymptomsCorrelatedOverTime"]["plot1"]')
[TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'draft.playerInventory.gardenItems
[playerInventorySlotNum].itemType')]
-----possible connected logout bug:
------ERROR  TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'newChartStats
["chart5SymptomsCorrelatedOverTime"]["plot1"]')
------This error is located at:
------    in TrackScreen (created by Connect(TrackScreen))
(/) this is a logout error:  ERROR  TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 
'newChartStats["chart5SymptomsCorrelatedOverTime"]["plot1"]')
(/) garden plots still turning to null?

    -add link to registration page 
(x) Add custom public profile icons 
(x) Add squished list of up to 7 profile icons in chat group card

(/) need to make all inputs more clickable, them seem to only be clickable where there are
-----written words? Need to also fix input boxes in chat, they're super janky and
-----inconsistent
(/) double check course changes are added
(/) finish db upgrades (make sure everyone's appstate's are fixed)




TODO later:

() add user profile pictures to chat
() there seems to be a multiline ios bug where the first line isn't in the grey box, only the words are


possilble bugs:

() there might be bugs generally with pressing buttons multiple times while waiting for async calls to 
-----resolve..... might call the methods multiple times and cause errors / crash 
() there seems to be a garden bug where the press a garden plot comes up without opening the menu 
------then it crashes whenever you select a garden plot 
() back on settings screens always adds add settings to stack before going back fully
() bottom list popup too high bug
() app startup goes straight to bad formatting of login deets, skips onboarding, never sees login 
-----screen, big bug, this happens on first time startup.... should be no previous saved data 



Low priority:
(---->) fix scroll up header where bottom half is missing
(---->) onboarding should probably remember answers if the user has already added them through settings (optional)
(---->) add glossery and word lookup
(---->)() NEED A BETTER IN APP TUTORIAL (when you first hit the Home Screen) 
--------(either click through highlight style, or todo list with links style)

*weekly notification about the course:
set of generic messages
(don't give it to people who haven't started the course)
-replaces the daily notification (noon on mondays would be good)

*daily notification for tracking
towards the end of the day
should be a trickle offset
give them the notification
-daily notifications (while they use the app daily)
-if they don't use the app for 3 days, drop to once a week



Don't forget to log your symptoms!






when they log in, manage push notification scheduling:
-schedule (3 daily, then 3 weekly)
-maintain a db of notification id's and timestamps they will trigger
-on login check notification id's, delete any ones in the past

-keep seperate lists for 3 daily, and 3 weekly
(if daily ever falls on a monday, put placeholder monday info to indicate the weekly notification is taking it's place)
-schedule additional daily and weekly push notifications to get both up to 3
