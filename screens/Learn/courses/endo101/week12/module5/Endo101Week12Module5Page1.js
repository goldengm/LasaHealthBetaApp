                          If you are dating, you might be anxious about bringing
                          it up and finding the right person who will support
                          you. Take things one step at a time. You don’t need to
                          bring it up on the first date if you don’t want to.
                          Nobody is entitled to know your medical history and
                          your endo doesn’t define you. Maybe you start by
                          mentioning that you have endometriosis and expand as
                          you feel comfortable.

                          {'\u000A'}
                          If the person you are dating isn’t supportive or
                          patient with the amount of information you want to
                          share or what you are going through, they might not be
                          the best person to have a relationship with. While
                          what you disclose is all on your own time, keep in
                          mind that if you feel like you want to make someone a
                          part of your life they would probably benefit from
                          knowing about something that plays such a large role
                          in your life. Telling a potential partner about your
                          endometriosis could help strengthen your relationship.

                          {'\u000A'}
                          You deserve someone who is supportive and
                          understanding of what you are going through.

                          A few weeks before my laparoscopy, I started talking
                          with someone. Initially I was afraid to share
                          everything with him, as I barely knew him, but I
                          decided I wanted to be upfront about the symptoms I
                          was having and explained that I was having surgery to
                          see if I had endometriosis. As I got to know this
                          person, I found that he was so supportive, researched
                          the condition himself, was willing to support me, and
                          even drove multiple times to come and visit me. Don’t
                          be afraid to date with this condition. Not everyone
                          will respond well, but someone who is supportive may
                          be worth getting to know better. Being honest is the
                          best way to learn about someone’s character upfront
                          and know if it is worth continuing to talk with them.”
