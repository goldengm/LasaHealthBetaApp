                          You may be wondering if and when you should tell an
                          employer about your situation. Know that you are in no
                          way required to disclose your medical situation to
                          your boss. If this is not something you feel would
                          benefit you, there is no need to tell them. However,
                          telling your boss about your endometriosis could help
                          you get any resources that will help you thrive in
                          your work. We understand that doing this could be
                          scary. That is why we’re going to talk about when and
                          how to talk to your manager about endometriosis.
                          {'\u000A'}
                          {'\u000A'}
                          When: You may be wondering when the best time to tell
                          them is. Some may want to be upfront and tell them in
                          the interview. This can help manage any expectations
                          and help them understand what you are going through
                          from the beginning. Remember, because of the ADA you
                          cannot be discriminated against for telling them about
                          your condition from the start. Others may choose to
                          tell someone after being offered a job and others
                          later on down the road. There is no right answer. It
                          is simply what feels best and right for you.
                          {'\u000A'}
                          {'\u000A'}
                          How: If you have multiple supervisors, choose one you
                          trust and feel comfortable with. If you prefer to talk
                          in person that’s great. You could also draft an email
                          if confrontation makes you anxious. We suggest
                          starting by telling them what you are experiencing and
                          maybe offering information on what endometriosis is.
                          After this, make it clear what you need. If you would
                          like for your boss to allow you to bring your TENS
                          machine to work, let them know that. Maybe you want to
                          talk to them about taking days off when you have
                          flare-ups. Go in with an idea of how they can best
                          help you and be willing to negotiate with them.
