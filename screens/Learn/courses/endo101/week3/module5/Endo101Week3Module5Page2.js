                          each time I got my period. I felt weird inflammation
                          in my hands. My back would hurt, and I had migraines.
                          I couldn't function because the pain level was so high
                          that I felt like someone was punching me two weeks out
                          of the month." - Elvira

                          wrong hormonally. Growing up, I feared my period
                          because of how much pain it would bring. When I was
                          30, I started fertility treatment because I wasn't
                          getting pregnant - first IUIs and then heavy IVF
                          medications. I think these medications worsened my
                          endometriosis symptoms. I started having urinary
                          problems and pain in my legs that was so severe that I
                          couldn't walk. I didn't know what was going on, but I
                          knew something was wrong." - Maddie

                          teens, but, growing up, I thought this was normal.
                          When I was in Physician Assistant school, I learned
                          about endometriosis and thought I had so many symptoms
                          of it. Over the next 1-2 years, my symptoms
                          progressed. I started having gastrointestinal symptoms
                          on or near the time of my period - nausea, vomiting,
                          constipation, diarrhea, and weight loss. I was almost
                          passing out on my period, having pain with bowel
                          movements, pelvic pain when trying to run or jump,
                          pain when emptying my bladder, and pain with using
                          tampons. Periods should not be so painful that you
                          pass out (or almost pass out)." - Abby
