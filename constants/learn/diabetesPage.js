    <div class="answer"><p>The three main types of diabetes are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Type 1 diabetes.</strong>&nbsp;Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease, meaning the body's immune (defense) system attacks and destroys the cells in the pancreas that make insulin. If you have type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin, so you must take insulin every day.</li>
	<li><strong>Type 2 diabetes.</strong>&nbsp;This is the most common type of diabetes. You can get type 2 diabetes at any age, even during childhood. With type 2 diabetes, your body does not make enough insulin or is not able to use its own insulin correctly. When this happens, blood glucose levels rise.</li>
	<li><strong>Gestational&nbsp;diabetes.</strong>&nbsp;Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that happens only during pregnancy. Gestational diabetes can cause health problems for the baby and the mother if not controlled. Although gestational diabetes goes away after your baby is born, having diabetes during pregnancy raises your risk for type 2 diabetes later on.<sup><a href="#references">2</a></sup>&nbsp;Learn more about&nbsp;<a href="http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/gestational/" title="What I need to know about Gestational Diabetes">gestational diabetes</a>&nbsp;at the National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse.</li>

    <div class="answer"><p>A risk factor is something that puts you at a higher risk for a disease compared to the average person.</p>

<p>Risk factors for&nbsp;<strong>type 1 diabetes</strong>&nbsp;in women and girls include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Age: It often develops in childhood.</li>
	<li>Family health history: Having a parent or brother or sister with type 1 diabetes</li>
	<li>Certain viral infections or illnesses, such as&nbsp;coxsackie&nbsp;virus B (a common cause of hand, foot, and mouth disease), rotavirus (also called stomach flu), and mumps<sup><a href="#references">3</a></sup></li>
	<li>Where you live: It is more common in people who live in colder climates.</li>
</ul>

<p>Risk factors for&nbsp;<strong>type 2 diabetes</strong>&nbsp;in women and girls include:<sup><a href="#references">4</a></sup></p>

<ul>
	<li>Overweight or obesity: Body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher for adults.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/english_bmi_calculator/bmi_calculator.html" title="Adult BMI calculator">Find out your BMI</a>.

	<li>Older age: 45 or older. After&nbsp;<a href="/menopause/" title="Menopause">menopause,</a>&nbsp;women are at higher risk for weight gain, especially more weight around the waist, which raises the risk for type 2 diabetes.</li>
	<li>Family health history: Having a mother, father, brother, or sister with diabetes</li>
	<li>Race/ethnicity: Family background of African-American, American Indian/Alaska Native, Hispanic, Asian-American, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander</li>
	<li>Having a baby that weighed 9 pounds or more at birth</li>
	<li>Having diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes)</li>
	<li>High blood pressure: Taking medicine for high blood pressure or having a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or higher. (Both numbers are important. If one or both numbers are usually high, you have high blood pressure.)</li>
	<li>High cholesterol: HDL cholesterol of 35 mg/dL or lower and triglycerides of 250 mg/dL or higher</li>
	<li>Lack of physical activity: Women who are active less than three times a week</li>
	<li>Having&nbsp;<a href="/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/polycystic-ovary-syndrome.html" title="Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) fact sheet">polycystic ovary syndrome</a>&nbsp;(PCOS)</li>
	<li>Personal history of&nbsp;<a href="/heart-disease-and-stroke" title="Heart Health and Stroke">heart disease or stroke</a></li>

<p>If you have any of these risk factors, talk to your doctor about ways to lower your risk for diabetes.
