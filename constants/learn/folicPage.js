    <div class="answer"><p><strong>Folic acid</strong> is the man-made form of <strong>folate,</strong> a B vitamin. Folate is found naturally in certain fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Folic acid is found in vitamins and fortified foods.</p>

<p>Folic acid and folate help the body make healthy new red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen to all the parts of your body. If your body does not make enough red blood cells, you can develop <a href="/a-z-topics/iron-deficiency-anemia">anemia</a>. Anemia happens when your blood cannot carry enough oxygen to your body, which makes you pale, tired, or weak. Also, if you do not get enough folic acid, you could develop a type of anemia called <a href="#13">folate-deficiency anemia</a>.</p>

      content: `

    <div class="answer"><p>Everyone needs folic acid to be healthy. But it is especially important for women:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong><em>Before</em> and <em>during</em> pregnancy.</strong> Folic acid protects unborn children against serious birth defects called neural tube defects. These birth defects happen in the first few weeks of pregnancy, often before a woman knows she is pregnant. Folic acid might also help prevent other types of birth defects and early pregnancy loss (miscarriage). Since about half of all pregnancies in the United States are unplanned<sup><a href="#references">1</a></sup>, experts recommend all women get enough folic acid even if you are not trying to get pregnant.</li>
	<li><strong>To keep the blood healthy by helping red blood cells form and grow.</strong> Not getting enough folic acid can lead to a type of <a href="/a-z-topics/iron-deficiency-anemia">anemia</a> called <a href="#13">folate-deficiency anemia</a>. Folate-deficiency anemia is more common in women of childbearing age than in men.</li>

<p>Neural tube defects are serious birth defects that affect the spine, spinal cord, or brain and may cause death. These include:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Spina bifida</strong>.<sup><a href="#references">6</a></sup> This condition happens when an unborn baby's spinal column does not fully close during development in the womb, leaving the spinal cord exposed. As a result, the nerves that control the legs and other organs do not work. Children with spina bifida often have lifelong disabilities. They may also need many surgeries.</li>

<ul>
	<li>Your birth control may not work or you may not use birth control correctly every time you have sex. In a survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, almost 40% of women with unplanned pregnancies were using birth control.<sup><a href="#references">8</a></sup></li>
	<li>Birth defects of the brain and spine can happen in the first few weeks of pregnancy, often before you know you are pregnant. By the time you find out you are pregnant, it might be too late to prevent the birth defects.</li>
	<li>You need to take folic acid every day because it is a water soluble B-vitamin. Water soluble means that it does not stay in the body for a long time. Your body metabolizes (uses) folic acid quickly, so your body needs folic acid each day to work properly.</li>
