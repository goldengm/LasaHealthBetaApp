	<li>A feeling of pressure, discomfort, aching, or fullness in the pelvis</li>
	<li>Pelvic pressure that gets worse with standing or coughing or as the day goes on</li>
	<li>Leaking urine (<a href="/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/urinary-incontinence.html">incontinence</a>) or problems having a bowel movement</li>
	<li>Problems inserting tampons</li>

    <div class="answer"><p>Pelvic organ prolapse happens when the muscles or connective tissues of the pelvis do not work as they should. The most common risk factors are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Vaginal childbirth,</strong> which can stretch and strain the pelvic floor. Multiple vaginal childbirths raise your risk for pelvic organ prolapse later in life.<sup><a href="#references">4</a></sup>&nbsp;But you can get prolapse even if you have never had children or if you had a cesarean, or C-section, delivery.</li>
	<li><strong>Long-term pressure on your abdomen,</strong> including pressure from obesity, chronic coughing, or straining often during bowel movements</li>
	<li><strong>Giving birth to a baby weighing more than 8Â½ </strong><strong>pounds</strong><a href="#references"><sup>5</sup></a></li>
	<li><strong>Aging.</strong> Pelvic floor disorders are more common in older women. About 37% of women with pelvic floor disorders are 60 to 79 years of age, and about half are 80 or older.<a href="#references"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
	<li><strong>Hormonal changes during <a href="/menopause">menopause</a>.</strong> Loss of the female hormone <a href="/glossary#estrogen">estrogen</a> during and after menopause can raise your risk for pelvic organ prolapse.

    <div class="answer"><p>Treatment for pelvic organ prolapse depends on the type of prolapse you have, your symptoms, your age, other health problems, and whether you are sexually active.</p>

<p>Your treatment may include one or more of the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong><a class="hint top-left" data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" href="#" rel="tooltip" title="PES-uh-ree">Pessary</a><em>.</em></strong> A pessary is a removable device inserted into the vagina to support the pelvic organs. Pessaries come in many different shapes and sizes. Pessaries are often the first treatment your doctor will try.<a href="#references"><sup>7</sup></a> Certain types of pessaries can treat both pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence.</li>
	<li><strong>Pelvic floor muscle therapy. </strong>Your doctor may show you how to do pelvic floor exercises or refer you to a physical therapist to do exercises to help strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. Pelvic floor muscle exercises can also help women who have pelvic organ prolapse as well as urinary incontinence.</li>
	<li><strong>Changing eating habits.</strong> If you have bowel problems, your doctor may recommend eating more foods with fiber. Fiber helps prevent constipation and straining during bowel movements. <a href="http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/digestive-diseases/fecal-incontinence/Pages/facts.aspx">Learn more about ways to treat fecal incontinence.</a></li>
	<li><strong>Surgery to support the uterus or vagina.</strong> During surgery, your doctor may use your own body tissue or synthetic mesh to help repair the prolapse and build pelvic floor support. This type of surgery is recommended for sexually active women with serious prolapse of the vagina or uterus. Surgery for prolapse can be done through your vagina or abdomen. Your doctor may use synthetic mesh to repair the prolapse through the abdomen. But, because of safety issues, mesh is no longer used to repair the prolapse through the vagina.<a href="#references"><sup>8</sup></a></li>
	<li><strong>Surgery to close the vagina. </strong>This surgery, called <a class="hint top-left" data-placement="top" data-toggle="tooltip" href="#" rel="tooltip" title="kol-po-KLI-sis">colpocleisis</a>, treats prolapse by closing the vaginal opening.
