    <div class="answer"><p>Anxiety disorders happen when excessive anxiety interferes with your everyday activities such as going to work or school or spending time with friends or family. Anxiety disorders are serious mental illnesses. They are the most common mental disorders in the United States. Anxiety disorders are more than twice as common in women as in men.</p>

      title: "What are the major types of anxiety disorder?",
      content: `

    <div class="answer"><p>The major types of anxiety disorder are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;People with&nbsp;GAD&nbsp;worry excessively about ordinary, day-to-day issues, such as health, money, work, and family. With GAD, the mind often jumps to the worst-case scenario, even when there is little or no reason to worry. Women with GAD may be anxious about just getting through the day. They may have muscle tension and other stress-related physical symptoms, such as trouble sleeping or upset stomach. At times, worrying keeps people with GAD from doing everyday tasks. Women with GAD have a higher risk of depression and other anxiety disorders than men with GAD. They also are more likely to have a family history of depression.<a href="#references"><sup>3</sup></a></li>
	<li><strong>Panic disorder</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Panic disorders are twice as common in women as in men.<a href="#references"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp;People with&nbsp;panic disorder&nbsp;have sudden attacks of terror when there is no actual danger. Panic attacks may cause a sense of unreality, a fear of impending doom, or a fear of losing control. A fear of oneâ€™s own unexplained physical symptoms is also a sign of panic disorder. People having panic attacks sometimes believe they are having heart attacks, losing their minds, or dying.</li>
	<li><strong>Social phobia.&nbsp;</strong>Social phobia, also called social anxiety disorder, is diagnosed when people become very anxious and self-conscious in everyday social situations. People with social phobia have a strong fear of being watched and judged by others. They may get embarrassed easily and often have panic attack symptoms.</li>
	<li><strong>Specific phobia.</strong>&nbsp;A&nbsp;specific phobia&nbsp;is an intense fear of something that poses little or no actual danger. Specific phobias could be fears of closed-in spaces, heights, water, objects, animals, or specific situations. People with specific phobias often find that facing, or even thinking about facing, the feared object or situation brings on a panic attack or severe anxiety.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some other conditions that are not considered anxiety disorders but are similar include:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;People with&nbsp;OCD&nbsp;have unwanted thoughts (obsessions) or behaviors (compulsions) that cause anxiety. They may check the oven or iron again and again or perform the same routine over and over to control the anxiety these thoughts cause. Often, the rituals end up controlling the person.</li>
	<li><strong>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</strong>&nbsp;PTSD&nbsp;starts after a scary event that involved physical harm or the threat of physical harm. The person who gets PTSD may have been the one who was harmed, or the harm may have happened to a loved one or even a stranger.</li>

      content: `

    <div class="answer"><p>Several types of medicine treat anxiety disorders. These include:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Antianxiety (benzodiazepines).</strong>&nbsp;These medicines are usually prescribed for short periods of time because they are addictive. Stopping this medicine too quickly can cause withdrawal symptoms.</li>
	<li><strong>Beta blockers.</strong>&nbsp;These medicines can help prevent the physical symptoms of an anxiety disorder, like trembling or sweating.<a href="#references"><sup>8</sup></a></li>
	<li><strong>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).</strong>&nbsp;SSRIs change the level of serotonin in the brain.<a href="#references"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;They increase the amount of serotonin available to help brain cells communicate with each other. Common side effects can include insomnia or sedation, stomach problems, and a lack of sexual desire.</li>
	<li><strong>Tricyclics</strong>. Tricylics work like SSRIs. But sometimes they cause more side effects than SSRIs. They may cause dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, constipation, or weight gain.</li>
	<li><strong>Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).</strong>&nbsp;People who take MAOIs must avoid certain foods and drinks (like Parmesan or cheddar cheese and red wine) that contain an amino acid called tyramine. Taking an MAOI and eating these foods can cause blood pressure levels to spike dangerously. Women who take MAOIs must also avoid certain medicines, such as some types of birth control pills, pain relievers, and cold and allergy medicines.<sup><a href="#">12</a>&nbsp;</sup>Talk to your doctor about any medicine you take.</li>
