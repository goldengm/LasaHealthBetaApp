      5. PAID SERVICES
      {"\n\n"}
      5.1 Fees. Certain products or services offered on or through the Services
      may be provided for a fee or other charge, including services or features
      for which access and use is purchased on a time limited basis (each a
      “Subscription”). You agree to pay all fees or charges to your Account in
      accordance with the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time
      a fee or charge is due and payable. Our current pricing and payment terms
      are listed here. The Company may add new products and services for
      additional fees and charges or amend fees and charges for existing
      products and services, at any time in its sole discretion. Any increased
      fees for existing Subscriptions will apply solely on a forward-looking
      basis beginning on your next billing period.
      {"\n\n"}
      5.2 Payment. All financial transactions made in connection with the
      Services will be processed by a third-party service provider (“Payment
      Service Provider”) in accordance with the Payment Service Provider’s terms
      of use and privacy policy. You may be required to provide the Payment
      Service Provider with information pertaining to a valid credit card (Visa,
      MasterCard, or any other issuer accepted by Payment Service Provider) or
      other permitted payment method (“Payment Information”). You agree that the
      Payment Service Provider is authorized to immediately charge your Payment
      Information for all fees and charges due and payable for the products and
      services hereunder and that, except as required under applicable law, no
      additional notice or consent is required. You agree to immediately notify
      the Payment Service Provider of any change in your billing address or
      Payment Information. Company reserves the right at any time to change its
      prices and billing methods, upon posting on the Services. Without limiting
      anything set forth therein, you acknowledge and agree that we may provide
      your Payment Information to our third-party service providers (e.g., our
      payment processing partner) for use pursuant to our Privacy Policy.
      {"\n\n"}
      5.3 Subscription. The fee for a Subscription will be billed by the Payment
      Service Provider or Company at the start of your Subscription or, if
      applicable, at the end of any free trial period, and at regular intervals
      in accordance with your elections at the time of purchase. The timing of
      billing may change at any time. Your Subscription will continue to
      automatically renew indefinitely, including if you stop using or accessing
      the Website, Services, or App, until your Subscription is canceled in
      accordance with the Agreement. After your initial Subscription period, and
      again after any subsequent Subscription period, your Subscription will
      automatically renew on the first day following the end of such period
      (each a “Renewal Commencement Date”) and continue for an additional
      equivalent period at Company’s then-current price for such Subscription.
      You agree that your Account will be subject to this automatic renewal
      feature (even if you otherwise terminate your Account, or stop using or
      accessing the Website, Services, or App) unless you cancel your
      Subscription prior to the Renewal Commencement Date in accordance with any
      terms between you and the Payment Service Provider. You have the option to
      opt out of the auto-renewal of your Subscription, or cancel your
      Subscription. If you cancel your Subscription, such cancellation will be
      effective as of the end of your then-current Subscription term (the
      “Cancellation Date”), and your Subscription will not be renewed after such
      then-current term. You will not be eligible for a prorated refund from
      Company of any portion of the fees paid for the then current period of
      your Subscription. By purchasing a Subscription, you authorize the
      applicable Payment Service Provider or Company to charge your Payment
      Information in accordance with your selected Subscription plan. Upon
      renewal of your Subscription, if the applicable Payment Service Provider
      or Company does not receive payment via your Payment Information, (a) you
      agree to pay all amounts due on your Account upon demand and/or (b) you
      agree that Payment Service Provider or Company may either cancel or
      suspend your Subscription and continue to attempt to charge your Payment
      Information until payment is received.
      {"\n\n"}
      5.4 Free Trials. Certain Subscription offerings may offer a free trial
      prior to charging your payment method, the period of which will be
      communicated to you via the Services. If you decide to cancel your
      Subscription before the Company starts charging your payment method, you
      must cancel the Subscription before the free trial ends. Otherwise, you
      will be responsible for payment for the full term of the Subscription
      period. We are offering a one (1) week free trial period. After the first
      week, [the free trial terminates, and your access automatically rolls over
      from a free trial to a regular Subscription and you are automatically
      charged the Fees set forth in Section 5.1].

      connection with the Services will be processed by the Payment Service
      Provider in accordance with their respective terms of use, privacy policy,

      will Company be responsible for the actions or inactions of any Payment
      Service Provider, including, but not limited to, system downtime or
      payment service outages, and any billing and fee disputes may require
      resolution between you and the Payment Service Provider. If you notify us
      of any fee or billing dispute, we will likely direct you to the Payment
      Service Provider to address such dispute, but to the extent we are able,
      we may assist you in resolving such dispute.

      obligation to collect a Sales Tax from you in connection with this
      Agreement, Company shall collect such Sales Tax in addition to the
      payments required under Section 5.1 of this Agreement. If any Services, or

      Tax in any jurisdiction and you have not remitted the applicable Sales Tax

      any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority, and you

      other such evidence that you have paid all applicable taxes. For purposes
      of this section, “Sales Tax” shall mean any sales or use tax and any other

      impose a sales or use tax.

      {"\n\n"}
      PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY. IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE
      DISPUTES WITH COMPANY AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF.
      THIS SECTION 15 OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE REFERRED TO AS THE “ARBITRATION
      AGREEMENT”.
      {"\n\n"}
      15.1 Scope of Arbitration Agreement. You agree that any dispute or claim
      relating in any way to your access or use of the Services as a User of the
      Services, to any advertising or marketing communications regarding Company
      or the Services, to any products or services sold or distributed through
      the Services that you received as a User of our Services, or to any aspect
      of your relationship or transactions with Company as a User of our
      Services will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court,
      except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims
      qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on
      an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis; and (2) you or
      Company may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other
      misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress,
      domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration
      Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or
      were asserted before the Effective Date of this Agreement.
      {"\n\n"}
      15.2 Informal Resolution. You and Company agree that good-faith informal
      efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, low-cost and
      mutually beneficial outcome. You and Company therefore agree that, before
      either you or Company demands arbitration against the other, we will
      personally meet and confer, via telephone or videoconference, in a
      good-faith effort to resolve informally any claim covered by this mutual
      Arbitration Agreement. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may
      participate in the conference, but you shall also fully participate in the
      conference. The party initiating the claim must give notice to the other
      party in writing of its, his, or her intent to initiate an informal
      dispute resolution conference, which shall occur within 60 days after the
      other party receives such notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed
      upon by the parties. To notify Company that you intend to initiate an
      informal dispute resolution conference, email support@lasahealth.com,
      providing your name, telephone number associated with your Company account
      (if any), the email address associated with your Company account, and a
      description of your claim. In the interval between the party receiving
      such notice and the informal dispute resolution conference, the parties
      shall be free to attempt to resolve the initiating party’s claims.
      Engaging in an informal dispute resolution conference is a requirement
      that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. The statute of
      limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties
      engage in the informal dispute resolution process required by this
      Section.
      {"\n\n"}
      15.3 Arbitration Rules and Forum. This Arbitration Agreement is governed
      by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) in all respects. If for whatever
      reason the rules and procedures of the FAA cannot apply, the state law
      governing arbitration agreements in the state in which you reside shall
      apply. Before a party may begin an arbitration proceeding, that party must
      send notice of an intent to initiate arbitration and certifying completion
      of the informal dispute resolution conference pursuant to Section 15.2. If
      this notice is being sent to Company, it must be sent by email to the
      counsel who represented Company in the informal dispute resolution
      process, or if there was no such counsel then by mail to 8 The Green Suite
      B Dover Delaware 19901. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS under
      its rules and pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Arbitration demands
      must include (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, and e-mail
      address of the party seeking arbitration; (2) a statement of the legal
      claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a
      description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good-faith calculation
      of the amount in controversy, enumerated in United States Dollars (any
      request for injunctive relief or attorneys’ fees shall not count toward
      the calculation of the amount in controversy unless such injunctive relief
      seeks the payment of money); and (4) the signature of the party seeking
      arbitration. Disputes shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of
      the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at
      http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/ all other disputes
      shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive
      Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at
      http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. JAMS’s rules are
      also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If
      the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS filing,
      administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver of
      fees from JAMS, Company will pay them for you. If JAMS is not available to
      arbitrate, the parties will mutually select an alternative arbitral forum.
      You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, video
      conference, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where
      you live or at another mutually agreed location.
      {"\n\n"}
      15.4 Arbitrator Powers. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or
      local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any
      dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or
      formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any
      claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or
      voidable. All disputes regarding the payment of arbitrator or
      arbitration-organization fees including the timing of such payments and
      remedies for nonpayment, shall be determined exclusively by an arbitrator,
      and not by any court. The arbitration will decide the rights and
      liabilities, if any, of you and Company. Except as expressly agreed to in
      Section 15 of this Agreement, the arbitration proceeding will not be
      consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other proceedings
      or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions
      dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will
      have the authority to award, on an individual basis, monetary damages and
      to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual
      under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Agreement
      (including this Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator will issue a
      written statement of decision describing the essential findings and
      conclusions on which any award (or decision not to render an award) is
      based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The award shall
      be binding only among the parties and shall have no preclusive effect in
      any other arbitration or other proceeding involving a different party. The
      arbitrator shall follow the applicable law. The arbitrator has the same
      authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court
      of law would have. The arbitrator’s decision is final and binding on you
      and Company.
      {"\n\n"}
      15.5 Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND COMPANY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND
      STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND RECEIVE A JUDGE OR JURY TRIAL. You
      and Company are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by
      arbitration, except as specified in Section 15.1 above. There is no judge
      or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is
      limited.
      {"\n\n"}
      15.6 Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY AGREED
      TO IN SECTION 15.7 OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND Company AGREE TO WAIVE ANY
      RIGHT TO RESOLVE CLAIMS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT ON
      A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES
      WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN
      INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS EXCEPT AS SET
      FORTH IN SECTION 15.7. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE
      ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER
      CUSTOMER OR USER EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 15.7. If, however, this
      waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable
      with respect to a particular claim or dispute, neither you nor Company is
      entitled to arbitration of such claim or dispute. Instead, all such claims
      and disputes will then be resolved in a court as set forth in Section
      16.2. This provision does not prevent you or Company from participating in
      a class-wide settlement of claims.
      {"\n\n"}
      15.7 Batch Arbitrations. To increase efficiency of resolution, in the
      event 100 or more similar arbitration demands against Company, presented
      by or with the assistance of the same law firm or organization, are
      submitted to an arbitration provider selected in accordance with the rules
      described above within a 30-day period, the arbitration provider shall (i)
      group the arbitration demands into batches of no more than 100 demands per
      batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 arbitration demands
      left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of
      the remaining demands); and (ii) provide for resolution of each batch as a
      single arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees and one
      arbitrator assigned per batch. You agree to cooperate in good faith with
      the Company and the arbitration provider to implement such a batch
      approach to resolution and fees.
      {"\n\n"}
      15.8 Opt-Out. Company’s updates to these Terms do not provide a new
      opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement for customers or Users
      who had previously agreed to a version of Company’s Terms and Conditions
      and did not validly opt out of arbitration. Company will continue to honor
      the valid opt outs of customers or Users who validly opted out of the
      Arbitration Agreement in a prior version of the Terms and Conditions. If
      you are a customer or User who creates a Company account for the first
      time on or after September 22, 2022, you may opt out of this Arbitration
      Agreement. If you do so, neither you nor Company can force the other to
      arbitrate as a result of this Agreement. To opt out, you must
      notifyCompany in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming
      subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name
      and address, your username (if any), the email address you currently use
      to access your account (if you have one), and a CLEAR statement that you
      want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. You must send your opt-out
      notice to: support@lasahealth.com. If you opt out of this Arbitration
      Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to
      you.
      {"\n\n"}
      15.9 Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive any termination of
      your relationship with the Company.
      {"\n\n"}
      15.10 Modification. Notwithstanding any provision in the Agreement to the
      contrary, we agree that if Company makes any future material change to
      this Arbitration Agreement, it will not apply to any individual claim(s)
      that you had already provided notice of to Company.

      provision. Throughout these Terms the use of the word “including” means
