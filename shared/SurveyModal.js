            Questions about surgery next week? Here‚Äôs what you need to know.

          <Text>
            Getting ready for your surgery? Here's a handy checklist of what to
            pack for your hospital stay:
          </Text>

          <Text></Text>
          <Text>
            Essential Documents: Don't forget your identification, insurance
            cards, and any necessary medical documents your doctor provided.
          </Text>
          <Text></Text>
          <Text>
            Comfortable Clothing: Pack loose, comfortable clothes for your
            journey to and from the hospital. You'll also want comfy pajamas or
            loungewear for your stay.
          </Text>
          <Text></Text>
          <Text>
            Toiletries: Bring your toothbrush, toothpaste, shampoo, soap, and
            any other personal hygiene items you prefer. Hospitals often provide
            basic toiletries, but having your own can be more comforting.
          </Text>
          <Text></Text>
          <Text>
            Glasses/Contact Lenses: If you wear glasses or contacts, make sure
            to pack them.
          </Text>
          <Text></Text>
          <Text>
            Chargers: Bring chargers for your phone and any other electronic
            devices you'll want to use during your stay.
          </Text>
          <Text></Text>
          <Text>
            Entertainment: Books, magazines, or electronic devices with
            headphones can help pass the time.
          </Text>
          <Text></Text>
          <Text>
            Medications: Bring any prescribed medications in their original
            containers.
          </Text>
          <Text></Text>
          <Text>
            Comfort Items: Consider bringing a favorite pillow, blanket, or
            other comfort items from home.
          </Text>
          <Text></Text>
          <Text>
            Snacks: Pack some light, non-perishable snacks for when you're
            allowed to eat after surgery. Packing a water bottle is also highly
            recommended!
          </Text>
          <Text></Text>
          <Text>
            List of Contacts: Have a list of important phone numbers ready in
            case you need to reach someone during your stay.
          </Text>
          <Text></Text>
          <Text>
            Remember, you may not need all these items, but having them can help
            make your hospital stay more comfortable. If you have any specific
            instructions from your doctor or hospital, be sure to follow those
            as well.

          <Text>
            You can take your regular medications on the morning of surgery with
            a sip of water unless advised otherwise.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            Remember to wash with chlorhexidine soap the night before and
            morning of your surgery for infection prevention.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            Take your regular medications with a sip of water unless advised
            otherwise.

          <Text>
            Arrive at the hospital at your scheduled time, and remember to have
            someone drive you home afterward.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            After surgery, please follow wound care instructions, avoid douching
            or tampons, and use a mini pad or sanitary napkin as needed.

            We hope you were able to rest up after your surgery! Here are some
            tips that can be helpful in the first few days:
          </Text>

          <Text></Text>
          <Text>
            Many patients have vaginal discharge or bleeding after surgery. This
            might continue for weeks and is a normal part of the healing
            process. Make sure to not place anything in your vagina (tampons,
            menstrual cups, douching, sexual acitivity, etc.) until after your
            postoperative appointment.
          </Text>
          <Text></Text>
          <Text>
            Your sensation of having a full bladder might be altered from
            anesthesia, swelling, surgery, or catheter use. Avoid having the
            bladder become too full by emptying every 2-3 hours during the day.
            If you have pain or burning with urination, make sure to call your
            care team!

            You might feel constipated or struggle to have a bowel movement.
            This is normal for the first 2 days after surgery, but here are some
            things that can help move your bowels:
          </Text>
          <Text></Text>
          <Text>
            Take a stool softener 1-3 times per day. You can get this medication
            over-the-counter at any pharmacy.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            Eat a high fiber diet with lots of fruits, veggies, and whole
            grains.
          </Text>
          <Text>Drink plenty of liquids.</Text>
          <Text>Chew gum!</Text>
          <Text></Text>

            Even if it is uncomfortable, make sure not to strain during bowel
            movements. If you still haven‚Äôt had a bowel movement after 3 days,
            take a laxative.
